**Today's Progress:** Built a simple temperature converter as my first C project.

**Thoughts:** Since I am just getting started with C, again after a loooong time, I've decided to take things slowly and go back to basics. The idea is to start with very simple projects and progress toward more complex ones.

**Today's Progress:** Built a simple Hangman game.

**Thoughts:** This is a very simple version of a Hangman game. There is no graphics or anything, just 1 word to be guessed, always the same. In the future, I should find a much better, more user-friendly way to build this. Might even use some graphics :).
